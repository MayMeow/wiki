## Contributing

Repository is readonly to all external users. And it is located [On my Gitlab](https://gitlab.cloud.themaymeow.com/maymeowhq/personal/php-encrypt) and on it's mirror [on Github](https://github.com/MayMeow/php-encrypt). However you can still contribute by combination of `format-patch` and email.

1. Create new branch

``` bash
it checkout -b <your branch name>
```

2. Create new commit from your changes and make patch.

``` bash
git add <file>
git commit
git format-patch -o /tmp/ HEAD^
```

3. Send you patch to my email.

**Please DO NOT** make changes right inside master branch. I will not accept that.
